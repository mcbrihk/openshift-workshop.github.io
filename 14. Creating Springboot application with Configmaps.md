In this exercise we will learn how to create a Springboot application and use ConfigMaps for addressing properties

**Step 1: Create a project or use an existing project**

If you want to, you can create a new project based on what you have learned in previous labs. Or you can create a new project for JBoss Applications.

**Remember** to replace the username before running the command.

```sh
$ oc new-project myspringboot-UserName --display-name="My Springboot Applications"
```

**Step 2: Create a springboot builder image**

We will be building an builder image called  "springboot-maven3-centos" from the repo  (found [here](https://github.com/debianmaster/springboot-maven3-centos.git) ). Taking that source-code; we will use the JBoss ImageStream (or the builder image) to assemble our application. 

```sh
$ oc new-build https://github.com/debianmaster/springboot-maven3-centos.git --strategy=docker --name=springboot-maven3-centos 
```
**Step 3: Check the status of build**

```sh
oc get is  #image streams
```
> you should see springboot-maven3-centos image stream listed.  check the build progress in UI    


**Step 4: Create springboot application using the builder image**

```sh
$ oc new-app springboot-maven3-centos~https://github.com/debianmaster/springboot-sample-app.git --name=spring-app
```
Give it some time and you will see OpenShift starts the build process for you. You can view the list of builds using `oc get builds` command.

```
$ oc get builds
NAME      TYPE      STATUS    POD
spring-app-1      Source    Running   spring-app-1-build
```

Note the name of the build that is running i.e. spring-app-1. We will use that name to look at the build logs. Run the command as shown below to look at the build logs. This will run for a few mins. At the end you will notice that the docker image is successfully created and it will start pushing this to OpenShift's internal docker registry.


```sh
$ oc get pods
NAME         READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
spring-app-1-build   1/1       Running   0          11m

$ oc logs pod/spring-app-1-build
```


You will notice that in the logs that not only does it copy your source code to the builder image, but it also does a `maven` build to compile your code as well. Also, in the above log, note how the image is pushed to the local docker registry. The registry is running at 172.30.x.x at port 5000.

**Step 5: Deployment**

Once the image is pushed to the docker registry, OpenShift will trigger a deploy process. Let us also quickly look at the deployment configuration by running the following command. Note dc represents deploymentconfig.

```sh
$ oc get dc spring-app -o json
```
Note where the image is picked from. It shows that the deployment picks the image from the local registry (same ipaddress and port as in buildconfig) and the image tag is the same as what we built earlier. This means the deployment step deploys the application image what was built earlier during the build step.

If you get the list of pods, you'll notice that the application gets deployed quickly and starts running in its own pod.

```
$ oc get pods
NAME         READY     STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE
spring-app-1-build   0/1       Completed   0          26m
spring-app-1-ey7m2   1/1       Running     0          12m
```

**Step 6: Adding route**

This step is very much the same as what we did in previous exercises. We will check the service and add a route to expose that service. 

```
$ oc get service spring-app
NAME      CLUSTER_IP     EXTERNAL_IP   PORT(S)             SELECTOR                     AGE
spring-app        172.30.139.2   <none>        8080/TCP,8443/TCP   app=spring-app,deploymentconfig=spring-app   27m
```

```
$ oc expose service spring-app
route "spring-app" exposed
```

```
$ oc get routes
NAME  HOST/PORT                                PATH  SERVICE   LABELS    INSECURE POLICY   TLS TERMINATION
spring-app    spring-app-myspringboot-Username.apps.cloud.ck.osecloud.com   ks    app=ks        
```

**Step 7: Run the application**

Now run the application by using the route you provided in the previous step. You can use either curl or your browser.

```sh
$ curl spring-app-myspringboot-UserName.apps.cloud.ck.osecloud.com
```
Go to https://spring-app-myspringboot-Username.apps.cloud.ck.osecloud.com via your browser. Please replace your username with yours.


## Using ConfigMaps to override application.properties

**Step1 create configmap**

```sh
oc create configmap example-configmap --from-file=./application.properties
# OR
oc create -f example-configmap.yml
```

**Step2 use configmap example-configmap  inside application deployment config**

> Modify the spring-app deployment config with following **volumes** , **volumeMounts** and *securityContext* section based on the example below  


```yml
  spec:
    volumes:
      -
        name: config-volume
        configMap:
          name: example-config
    containers:
      -
        name: springapp
        image: '172.30.240.125:5000/sample/springapp@sha256:a2c13c7f96e32e44c99e21bc51fa07086bb553d21635dd8f1b9f1b54aed148ad'
        ports:
          -
            containerPort: 8080
            protocol: TCP
        resources: {  }
        volumeMounts:
          -
            name: config-volume
            mountPath: /opt/app-root/src/src/main/resources
        terminationMessagePath: /dev/termination-log
        imagePullPolicy: Always
        securityContext: {  }
    restartPolicy: Always
    terminationGracePeriodSeconds: 30
    dnsPolicy: ClusterFirst
    securityContext:
      fsGroup: 7777
```
