Now click on the CLI Project to view the details. OpenShift takes you by default to the `Overview` page and shows you a graphic representation of the application that is deployed here. You can see that a single pod is running and is frontended by a service. Note the route that you configured for this service is also shown.
You will also see the `Add to Project` button on the right top. This can be used to create new application from Web Console inside this project.
